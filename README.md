We have attached the test datasets below. Download these and the python script into the same file and copy past the location of the csv file you wish to use onto the appropriate place in the Python programme Moonquake for it to use that csv file. Upon execution, the location of the quake will be given as the output. The program also outputs the solution into a Unity file "Seismometer".

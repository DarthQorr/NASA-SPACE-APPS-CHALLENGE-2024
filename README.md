# NASA-SPACE-APPS-CHALLENGE-2024
This is a program that predicts when a quake begins using data from the provided CSV files. The Python Program "Moonquake" is what does this, and it outputs the result onto a Unity file "" that displays the results graphically. As the datasets are extremely large, they have not been included in this repository. We have, instead attached a Video that demonstrates our work.

The Unity file is avalable in the following Google Drive folder: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fZ4a5a1usPYgquFGGjRPe-eke2HGu7D6?usp=sharing 

It must be downloaded and used as a single folder.
